      <p>
        Hi, I&#39;m Carl, a web developer with over two years of experience in
        frontend development, now transitioning into full-stack development. I
        specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, and PostgreSQL, with
        growing expertise in backend and cloud development using AWS web
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy building web applications and exploring new technologies to push
        my skills further. Lately, I&#39;ve been expanding my knowledge in
        Docker and cloud deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about 3D printing, making keyboards from
        scratch, and recently, game development. My current goal is to create
        tools that help me expand my skillset, learn new technologies, and
        refine my problem-solving abilities.
      </p>
